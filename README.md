A fully responsive Bootstrap tower site with HTML5 and CSS3 goodies.

I developed this project through the Udemy course by Ryan Bonhardt, "Learn to Build Beautiful HTML5 & CSS3 Websites in 1
Month".  This project utilizes the Bootstrap Jumbotron template, as well as the nav from the Starter template.  It also 
includes Font Awesome icons, a fixed "Go-to-top" arrow, a modal with an embedded YouTube video, smooth scroll and scrollspy.  

One of the benefits of this project is that it gave me a greater familiarization with Bootstrap features and how to incorporate them into my projects.
